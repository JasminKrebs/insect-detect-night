# System settings
powermanager:
  enabled: true     # Disable if no power management board is connected
  model: wittypi    # Power management board model (options: wittypi, pijuice)
  charge_min: 20    # Minimum required battery charge level (%) to start/continue a recording
  charge_check: 30  # Time interval (seconds) for checking battery charge level during recording
oak:
  temp_max: 100     # Maximum allowed OAK chip temperature (Â°C) to continue a recording
  temp_check: 30    # Time interval (seconds) for checking OAK chip temperature during recording
storage:
  disk_min: 1000    # Minimum required free disk space (MB) to start/continue a recording
  disk_check: 60    # Time interval (seconds) for checking free disk space during recording
logging:
  enabled: false    # Log system information (temperature, memory, CPU utilization, battery info)
  interval: 30      # Time interval (seconds) for saving logs during recording

# Camera settings
camera:
  fps: 20              # Camera frame rate (range: 1-30) -> higher fps increases power consumption
  resolution:          # Resolution of HQ frames (captured images)
    width: 3840        # Frame width (max. 3840) -> must be multiple of 32, e.g. 2176 for ~square
    height: 2160       # Frame height (max. 2160)
  jpeg_quality: 80     # JPEG quality of captured images (range: 0-100)
  focus:
    mode: continuous   # Options: continuous, range, manual
    distance:
      enabled: true    # Use distance-based focus (in cm)
      range:
        min: 15        # Minimum auto focus position (distance to camera in cm)
        max: 20        # Maximum auto focus position (distance to camera in cm)
      manual: 19       # Manual focus position (distance to camera in cm)
    lens_position:
      enabled: false   # Use lens position-based focus (0-255)
      range:
        min: 154       # Minimum lens position (range: 0-255) - greater distance to camera
        max: 165       # Maximum lens position (range: 0-255) - shorter distance to camera
      manual: 156      # Manual lens position (range: 0-255)
  isp:
    sharpness: 1       # Image sharpness (range: 0-4) - setting to 0 can reduce artifacts
    luma_denoise: 1    # Luminance noise reduction (range: 0-4) - setting to 0 can reduce artifacts
    chroma_denoise: 1  # Chrominance noise reduction (range: 0-4)

# Recording settings
recording:
  duration:
    default: 60    # Duration (minutes) per recording session if powermanager is disabled
    battery:
      high: 60     # Duration (minutes) if battery charge level is > 70% or USB power is connected
      medium: 40   # Duration (minutes) if battery charge level is between 50-70%
      low: 20      # Duration (minutes) if battery charge level is between 30-50%
      minimal: 10  # Duration (minutes) if battery charge level is < 30%
  capture_detection:
    interval: 1.0  # Time interval (seconds) for saving HQ frame + metadata while object is detected
  capture_timelapse:
    interval: 600  # Time interval (seconds) for saving HQ frame (independent of detected objects)

# Detection settings
